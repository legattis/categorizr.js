Operations, Compliance & Information Flow Manual

“From Mystery to Mastery – How NX Finally Works”

⸻

I. Purpose & Vision

We control the information → we control the inventory → we satisfy compliance.

This manual is the operating blueprint for nonexpendable equipment (NX) management in Pittsburgh. It replaces scattered file chasing and ad-hoc processes with a disciplined flow of information. Every request, every record, every compliance checkpoint is tied into PADMD, ensuring accountability from intake to disposition.

Core Principles
	•	Control the information, control the inventory. Every physical action produces a data signal.
	•	Transparency: Any stakeholder can see status without chasing files.
	•	Compliance: VA Handbook 7002, Directive 1761, VISN QCR, and OIG findings are hard-coded into workflows.
	•	Efficiency: Information flows to us; NX does not chase it down.
	•	Adaptability: The model is platform-agnostic. Dashboards and automations are UI layers on top of an enforced data structure.
	•	Accountability: IMS, COs, Material Handling, Scan, and customer shops each carry defined data responsibilities.

This is not a SharePoint plan. It is a compliance plan built on the flow of information.

⸻

II. Stakeholders & Roles
	•	Internal NX: Supervisor, IMS, Scan Team, Material Handling.
	•	External: OIT, Biomed, FMS, clinical/admin services.
	•	Leadership: Facility Director, VISN leadership, auditors.
	•	Oversight Anchors: Accountable Officer (AO), Custodial Officers (COs).

Material Handling is integral where it belongs: receipts, staging, and physical transfers of equipment. Every action handled by MH generates a corresponding data entry in the NX system.

III. How the System Works
	1.	Intake – All requests come through structured intake forms. No email-first processes.
	2.	Processing – Requests are routed into PADMD (Planning → Acquisition → Deployment → Maintenance → Disposition).
	3.	Storage – Records are stored by process, not duplicated by service line or EIL.
	4.	Metadata – Every file tagged with: Service Line, EIL, Request Type, Status, IMS Owner, FY, Due Date.
	5.	Information Flow – IMS and Material Handling actions automatically generate data signals. COs must request changes through intake, not bypass NX.
	6.	Views – Leadership sees compliance summaries, IMS see monitors, auditors see ROS status.

Files do not drive the process. The process drives the files.

IV. PADMD-Aligned Structure & Compliance Mapping

Planning
	•	SEPG preparation, OA3, IMS assignments, strategic forecasts.
	•	IMS must become SEPG experts; improper routing of equipment with no EIL must end.
	•	Equipment Committee notes and 5-year replacement plans are documented here.

Compliance tie: Proactively prevents idle or untracked assets, ensures EILs are set before acquisition, and satisfies QCR demands for forward planning.

⸻

Acquisition
	•	Requisitions, approvals, receiving.
	•	All NX assets are EE-tagged upon receipt in MH/Receiving before deployment or delivery.
	•	Emergency purchases are logged with the same rigor as planned acquisitions.

Compliance tie: Prevents ghost equipment; ensures all assets are tied to an EIL at entry.

⸻

Deployment
	•	IMS update all equipment locations directly in the system.
	•	COs and delegates are required to request all changes (relocation, repurpose, loan, etc.) through formal intake.
	•	Material Handling movements are logged as data events.

Compliance tie: Closes the OIG-identified gap where 33% of assets were not at the recorded location.

⸻

Maintenance
	•	Annual Inventories: Every accountable item is checked annually, no exceptions. <95% accuracy triggers re-check within 6 months.
	•	Loan Registry: Continuous record of all assets on loan.
	•	Bill-of-Health Reports: Required for all assets deemed reusable. Responsibility lies with OIT, Biomed, and FMS trades (plumbing, electrical, electronics, etc.). NX does not chase this documentation; shops must submit it with the asset. No NX item moves to Excess without a bona fide Bill of Health.
	•	Repairs & Research Equipment: Documented until resolved or disposed.

Compliance tie: Prevents re-use of unverified or unsafe equipment, directly addressing OIG concerns about idle or misclassified gear.

⸻

Disposition
	•	Turn-ins, inspections, ROS, excess, Unicor, recycling, disposal confirmations.
	•	New tools unify Pittsburgh’s historically scattered processes into a single robust workflow.
	•	ROS tracked through initiation → approval → closure; 60-day compliance enforced.
	•	Excess postings require Bills of Health before acceptance, making the responsibility sit squarely on customer shops and service providers.
	•	Material Handling supports staging and transfer, ensuring custody is documented from turn-in through disposal.

Compliance tie: Directly addresses OIG findings of unresolved ROS reports and idle equipment left in limbo.

⸻

Contingency
	•	Outage-proof intake: controlled templates, spreadsheets, and Uber-Tracker.
	•	Post-outage reconciliation flows back into PADMD.

Compliance tie: Ensures auditors see continuous accountability regardless of system status.

⸻

V. Governance & Oversight
	•	Quarterly governance reviews: Forms, taxonomy, compliance checkpoints updated.
	•	EIL oversight: Custodial officer assignments validated and corrected through scheduled review, not left to drift.
	•	Annual review: AO, COs, and leadership jointly review inventories, ROS performance, and compliance metrics.

Result: Facility Directors and AOs cannot defer oversight; compliance is visible and enforced.

⸻

VI. Dashboards (Proof-of-Concept Windows)

The dashboards are not the system; they are windows into the system.
	•	PPM monitors: Requests, inventories, and dispositions by IMS or EIL.
	•	OIT counters: Simple in/out tallies.
	•	ROS view: Per-IMS snapshot of active reports and their statuses, tied directly into the official portal.
	•	Libraries & metadata: Enable emerging views by Service Line or EIL.

Dashboards are in proof-of-concept stage today and will evolve. Their purpose is to surface compliance data, not replace the underlying structure.

SharePoint is just the UI. The real control is the enforced data flow.

⸻

VII. OIG/QCR Compliance Alignment
	•	Lost Assets: Prevented by mandatory tagging + annual inventories.
	•	Location Accuracy: Maintained by IMS updates, triggered by CO requests.
	•	Idle/Unused Assets: Planning and Disposition pipelines force transfer, reuse, or disposal.
	•	Inventories: Annual, no exception.
	•	Reports of Survey: Centralized, tracked, closed within 60 days.
	•	Oversight: Facility Directors and AOs must act on compliance data presented live.

⸻

VIII. Contingency Operations
	•	Trigger: System outage.
	•	Intake: Controlled templates and tracker.
	•	Reconciliation: All actions migrated back into PADMD.

⸻

IX. Bottom Line

This plan is platform-agnostic, data-centric, and compliance-driven.
	•	Material Handling is present where it supports the flow.
	•	IMS own SEPG and EIL accountability.
	•	COs must request changes through intake.
	•	Customer shops are responsible for certifying equipment condition before Excess.
	•	Dashboards remain simple proof-of-concept, but the underlying data flow already enforces compliance.

We control the information → we control the inventory → we satisfy compliance.
