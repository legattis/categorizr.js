-------------------------------------------------

2. Step-by-Step Build Guide

Home Page
	•	Use Hero Web Part for the three big buttons (Training / Reference / Updates).
	•	Add a Quick Links web part for Mail Stop List, Logs, Contacts.

Training Page
	•	Use Collapsible Sections (the accordion style you already started).
	•	For Required Training:
	•	Keep your TMS list.
	•	Add a simple list/table for “Who’s completed what” (clerks can update).
	•	For Local Training:
	•	Break into “Daily Operations,” “Machines,” and “Logs” sections.
	•	Link each topic to a 1-page SOP or short PDF.
	•	For External Training:
	•	Link out to USPS/NPF/MDP with a note on TMS credit if relevant.

Reference Page
	•	Create a Mail Stop Directory List in SharePoint (not static text).
	•	Columns: Building | Floor | Dept | Notes | Last Updated By.
	•	Set permissions so all clerks can add/edit.
	•	Logs & Forms: Upload blank templates and instructions.
	•	Contacts: Small web part with Lead/Supervisor/Backup info.
	•	Machines: Upload 1-page cheat sheets or short guides.

Updates Page
	•	Use News web part (perfect for “Lead’s Notes”).
	•	Williams can add a quick note (title, 2–3 sentences).
	•	Reverse chronological display (most recent on top).

⸻

3. Recommended Flows (to make updating easier)

Here’s where automation makes it painless:
	1.	Mail Stop Directory Flow
	•	Trigger: When an item in “Mail Stop Directory” list is updated.
	•	Action: Post a notification in “Updates” page (e.g., “Mail Stop List updated by Karen W on 8/25”).
	•	Benefit: Everyone sees when changes happen, no confusion.
	2.	Training Completion Tracker Flow
	•	Trigger: When a clerk marks a training item as “Completed” in the Training List.
	•	Action: Send auto-email to Lead + Supervisor with summary.
	•	Benefit: No chasing, accountability is logged.
	3.	Updates Posting Flow
	•	Trigger: When Williams adds a News post.
	•	Action: Auto-email to clerks with subject: “Mailroom Update – [Title].”
	•	Benefit: Reinforces that updates are official, visible, and backed by you.
	4.	Log Oversight Flow (Optional)
	•	Trigger: If a required log (Pharmacy, Radiology, Custody Transfer) hasn’t been updated in X days.
	•	Action: Send reminder to responsible clerk + CC Lead.
	•	Benefit: Prevents lapses in regulated logs.

⸻

✅ Bottom line: this structure gives you clarity (3 clean sections), authority reinforcement (Lead’s updates are official), and automation (flows keep everyone accountable without you chasing them).


Tracking KW Updates & Acknowledgment

Updates Page Setup
	•	Keep using the News web part (KW posts changes/announcements).
	•	Add a custom list called “Mailroom Update Acknowledgment” with these columns:
	•	Update Title/ID (linked to the News post)
	•	Posted By (auto = KW)
	•	Date Posted
	•	Acknowledged By (Person field, allows multiple entries)
	•	Date Acknowledged

Clerks would go in and simply click “+ New” → Add their name to show they’ve read it.

⸻

Flow to Automate Acknowledgment Tracking
	•	Trigger: When KW creates a new News post.
	•	Action:
	1.	Auto-create a new item in “Mailroom Update Acknowledgment” with that post’s Title + Date.
	2.	Send an email/Teams message to clerks: “New Mailroom Update Posted: [Title]. Please acknowledge here → [link to acknowledgment list].”
	•	Optional Escalation: If not all clerks acknowledge within 48 hours, send reminder to clerk + CC KW (and you, if needed).

⸻

Dashboard / Visibility
	•	Add a small list web part to the Updates page that shows:
	•	Update Title | Date | % of clerks acknowledged.
	•	This lets KW and you instantly see who’s read her updates.

⸻

✅ Result:
	•	Every time KW posts, it automatically becomes a required acknowledgment item.
	•	Clerks can’t ignore her or claim they “didn’t know” because you’ll have a paper trail.
	•	It reinforces KW’s authority and makes her updates official, trackable instructions.

List: Mailroom Update Acknowledgment

Create the list
	1.	New list → Mailroom Update Acknowledgment
	2.	Description: “Clerks confirm they’ve read operational updates.”

Columns (add in this order)
	•	Update Title – Single line of text (Required)
Short name of the update (matches the News/SOP title).
	•	Update Link – Hyperlink (Required)
URL to the News post/SOP/change note.
	•	Acknowledged By – Person or Group (Required; single selection)
Leave “Allow selection of Groups” = No.
	•	Acknowledged On – Date and Time (Optional display; defaults to Created)
No need to show on form; it’s for views/audits.
	•	Notes (optional) – Multiple lines of text
Use for quick comments like “Reviewed with Pharmacy.”

Leave the built-in Title column; rename it to Record ID (or hide in forms) to avoid confusion.

Settings
	•	Versioning: On → Create a version each time you edit an item
	•	Advanced settings → Item-level permissions:
	•	Read access: Read all items
	•	Create and Edit access: Create items and edit items that were created by the user
(Prevents people from editing others’ acknowledgments.)
	•	Content types: Off (keep it simple)

Permissions
	•	Owners: Full Control (you, lead)
	•	Members (clerks): Contribute
	•	Visitors (if any): Read

Views (add these)
	1.	All Acknowledgments (default)
	•	Columns: Update Title, Update Link, Acknowledged By, Acknowledged On
	•	Sort: Acknowledged On (Descending)
	2.	My Acknowledgments
	•	Filter: Acknowledged By is equal to [Me]
	•	Columns: Update Title, Update Link, Acknowledged On
	•	Sort: Acknowledged On (Descending)
	3.	By Update
	•	Group by: Update Title (Ascending)
	•	Columns: Acknowledged By, Acknowledged On
	•	Expand groups: Collapsed

Form tweaks (fast, no code)
	•	New item form order: Update Title → Update Link → Acknowledged By → Notes
	•	Hide Acknowledged On from the form (it’s auto-captured as Created).
	•	Add a Help text note (List settings → Form settings):
“Open the update, then submit this acknowledgment. Use Notes only if you coordinated with another service.”

How clerks will use it
	•	From the Updates page (your News post), include a link: “Acknowledge this update” → points to the list’s New item form.
	•	Clerk fills Update Title, Update Link (paste), confirms Acknowledged By (auto-resolves themselves), Save. Done.

⸻

Optional (nice-to-have, still no premium anything)
	•	Add a List web part on the Updates page showing the By Update view so KW/you can see roll-ups at a glance.
	•	Add a Quick Link button labeled “New Acknowledgment” that opens the New form directly.

Manager’s Summary – Mailroom Lead Concerns
	•	Context:
	•	Karen Williams is the designated lead for Mailroom/Repro. She directs workflow and assigns daily tasks but does not have full supervisory authority.
	•	Long-standing conflict exists between Williams and Karen Faison: Williams can be abrasive, Faison can be dramatic/resistant, which creates recurring friction.
	•	With fiscal year-end (9/30), my focus has been heavily on PPM, so I’ve been less present in the mailroom. This has left Williams feeling unsupported in her leadership role.
	•	Current Issue:
	•	Williams formally requested relief from lead duties, citing workload strain, resistance from clerks, and lack of supervisory backup.
	•	While her concerns are valid, the lead position is essential and must remain in place.
	•	Assessment:
	•	Williams is correct that she has been carrying the operation with minimal visible support.
	•	The gap is less about her ability and more about consistent communication, reinforced training, and supervisory follow-up.
	•	Path Forward:
	1.	Reaffirm her role – Make clear to all clerks that Williams’s instructions carry supervisory backing.
	2.	Increase communication – Provide more frequent check-ins and ensure escalations are addressed promptly so Williams doesn’t feel isolated.
	3.	Training reinforcement – I will retrain Faison and the HZ clerks on procedures (mail stops, certified/lab mail, etc.) and reinforce standards.
	4.	Centralized reference materials – Build and maintain a single set of updated operating guides, instructions, and mail stop information so all clerks have the same baseline and Williams can post updates consistently.
	5.	Accountability – Regular monitoring and supervisory reinforcement to ensure clerks follow established procedures.
	•	Next Steps:
	•	Meet with Dennis (and possibly Nicki) to align expectations.
	•	Immediately begin communication and training reinforcement.
	•	Establish centralized reference materials so Williams has backing and the clerks have clarity.


Mailroom Lead Concerns – Executive Summary
	•	Karen Williams (lead) reports feeling unsupported and overwhelmed due to ongoing conflict with Karen Faison and limited supervisory presence.
	•	Her request to step down reflects strain, not inability — the lead role is essential and must remain in place.
	•	Core issue is not leadership but gaps in communication, training consistency, and supervisory reinforcement.
	•	Plan:
	•	Reaffirm Williams’s authority as lead.
	•	Increase supervisory communication and support.
	•	Retrain clerks to standardize procedures.
	•	Maintain centralized reference materials so all staff follow the same guidance.
	•	Goal: Reduce friction, strengthen accountability, and ensure Williams has visible supervisory backing.


“Karen’s concerns are valid — she’s carrying the mailroom without much visible backup. The lead role has to stay in place, but the real issue is communication, training consistency, and accountability. My plan is to reaffirm her authority, retrain clerks where needed, and keep clear, centralized reference materials so everyone’s aligned.”

“Thanks for raising your concerns, Karen — I hear you, and I’ll be addressing support, communication, and training so you’re not left carrying this on your own.”
