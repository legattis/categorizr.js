Manager’s Summary – Mailroom Lead Concerns
	•	Context:
	•	Karen Williams is the designated lead for Mailroom/Repro. She directs workflow and assigns daily tasks but does not have full supervisory authority.
	•	Long-standing conflict exists between Williams and Karen Faison: Williams can be abrasive, Faison can be dramatic/resistant, which creates recurring friction.
	•	With fiscal year-end (9/30), my focus has been heavily on PPM, so I’ve been less present in the mailroom. This has left Williams feeling unsupported in her leadership role.
	•	Current Issue:
	•	Williams formally requested relief from lead duties, citing workload strain, resistance from clerks, and lack of supervisory backup.
	•	While her concerns are valid, the lead position is essential and must remain in place.
	•	Assessment:
	•	Williams is correct that she has been carrying the operation with minimal visible support.
	•	The gap is less about her ability and more about consistent communication, reinforced training, and supervisory follow-up.
	•	Path Forward:
	1.	Reaffirm her role – Make clear to all clerks that Williams’s instructions carry supervisory backing.
	2.	Increase communication – Provide more frequent check-ins and ensure escalations are addressed promptly so Williams doesn’t feel isolated.
	3.	Training reinforcement – I will retrain Faison and the HZ clerks on procedures (mail stops, certified/lab mail, etc.) and reinforce standards.
	4.	Centralized reference materials – Build and maintain a single set of updated operating guides, instructions, and mail stop information so all clerks have the same baseline and Williams can post updates consistently.
	5.	Accountability – Regular monitoring and supervisory reinforcement to ensure clerks follow established procedures.
	•	Next Steps:
	•	Meet with Dennis (and possibly Nicki) to align expectations.
	•	Immediately begin communication and training reinforcement.
	•	Establish centralized reference materials so Williams has backing and the clerks have clarity.


Mailroom Lead Concerns – Executive Summary
	•	Karen Williams (lead) reports feeling unsupported and overwhelmed due to ongoing conflict with Karen Faison and limited supervisory presence.
	•	Her request to step down reflects strain, not inability — the lead role is essential and must remain in place.
	•	Core issue is not leadership but gaps in communication, training consistency, and supervisory reinforcement.
	•	Plan:
	•	Reaffirm Williams’s authority as lead.
	•	Increase supervisory communication and support.
	•	Retrain clerks to standardize procedures.
	•	Maintain centralized reference materials so all staff follow the same guidance.
	•	Goal: Reduce friction, strengthen accountability, and ensure Williams has visible supervisory backing.
