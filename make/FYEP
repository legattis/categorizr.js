Safety and Security

Billy maintained an excellent safety record all year, staying alert and aware in every environment he worked in. He takes safety seriously, not just for himself but for everyone around him, and he’s consistent about keeping equipment areas orderly, secure, and free of hazards.

A great example came during the May 2025 annual cleanup. Billy not only directed the flow of equipment through congested hallways and docks with calm authority, he also ensured sensitive items were tracked and documented through every handoff. His mindfulness prevented both safety incidents and potential accountability lapses that day.

Earlier in the year, when another IMS fell behind on workload, Billy quietly stepped in to help. He assisted with data cleanup, shared his process tips, and checked in until things were back on track. That simple act of teamwork reflects his genuine care for others and commitment to shared success.
