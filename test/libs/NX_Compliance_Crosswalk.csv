OIG/QCR Finding,PADMD Stage,Practice / Control,How It Resolves the Gap
"Lost/unaccounted assets (~75,500 items)",Acquisition → Deployment → Maintenance,Tagging at receipt (MH/Receiving); IMS updates locations; Annual Inventories,"Assets are tagged on arrival, tracked through deployment, and physically verified annually with no exceptions."
Wrong locations (33% mismatch),Deployment,IMS responsible for updating all location changes; COs must request changes via intake; MH actions logged as data events,No silent moves. Every relocation requires a documented request; IMS updates system records.
"Idle/unused assets (~62,500 items)",Planning → Maintenance → Disposition,SEPG-driven planning; Bill-of-Health reviews; Disposition pipeline forces reuse/transfer/disposal,Planning prevents overbuying; shops certify condition; NX pipeline ensures assets don’t sit idle.
Inventory by exception loophole (20+ months between checks),Maintenance,"Annual inventories, no exceptions; <95% triggers 6-month re-check",Every accountable item seen annually. No reliance on maintenance history to bypass inventory.
"Incomplete or missing ROS (915 unfinished, $31.2M; 210 missing)",Disposition,ROS workflow with initiation → approval → closure tracked; 60-day closure enforced; dashboards provide IMS status views,"Every missing/damaged item generates a ROS; progress is visible until closure, meeting 60-day requirement."
Poor custodial oversight,Planning → Deployment → Maintenance,Custodial Officers must request changes; CO assignments validated during EIL governance reviews,CO responsibility is enforced; IMS implement changes only after CO request; assignments kept current.
Directors deferring oversight,Governance,Quarterly governance reviews; annual leadership compliance reviews,Facility Directors/AOs required to participate in scheduled compliance reviews; no passive deferral.
Unverified re-use/disposal,Maintenance → Disposition,"Bill-of-Health reports required from OIT, Biomed, FMS shops; no asset sent to Excess without certification","Responsibility sits with customer shops; NX receives documentation, doesn’t chase it."
Fragmented Pittsburgh processes,Disposition (all),Unified Turn-in/Disposition Log; ROS tracking; Excess/Unicor/Recycling channels integrated,Creates one robust process where scattered ones existed; documentation standardized across disposition routes.
System outages causing accountability gaps,Contingency,"Controlled templates, spreadsheets, Uber-Tracker; reconciliation into PADMD after outage",Continuous accountability even during outages; auditors see no blind spots.
