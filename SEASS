SEASS


Structure:
One paragraph per critical element — not just one overall paragraph.
If you have 5 critical elements, aim for 5 well-developed paragraphs, one for each.
Each paragraph should be a detailed narrative that:
States the element and its standard.
Describes how you met or exceeded expectations.
Includes specific accomplishments, metrics, or outcomes.
Highlights how your work supports the VA mission.
Depth & Detail:
Go in-depth. This is not a high-level summary — it’s your chance to document everything you’ve done that your supervisor might not remember.
Think of it as a performance portfolio: include projects, improvements, innovations, leadership, problem-solving, and any quantifiable results.
Use bullet points within paragraphs if needed to make accomplishments stand out.
Tone:
Be confident but factual — this is your time to “brag a little,” as the blurb says.
Use action verbs and results-oriented language (e.g., “streamlined,” “implemented,” “reduced processing time by 30%,” etc.).
