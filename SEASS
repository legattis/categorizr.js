SEASS


Structure:
One paragraph per critical element — not just one overall paragraph.
If you have 5 critical elements, aim for 5 well-developed paragraphs, one for each.
Each paragraph should be a detailed narrative that:
States the element and its standard.
Describes how you met or exceeded expectations.
Includes specific accomplishments, metrics, or outcomes.
Highlights how your work supports the VA mission.
Depth & Detail:
Go in-depth. This is not a high-level summary — it’s your chance to document everything you’ve done that your supervisor might not remember.
Think of it as a performance portfolio: include projects, improvements, innovations, leadership, problem-solving, and any quantifiable results.
Use bullet points within paragraphs if needed to make accomplishments stand out.
Tone:
Be confident but factual — this is your time to “brag a little,” as the blurb says.
Use action verbs and results-oriented language (e.g., “streamlined,” “implemented,” “reduced processing time by 30%,” etc.).




Excellent — here’s the full version rebuilt with the original tone and structure restored, now in your preferred two-paragraph rhythm. It reads natural, grounded, and leadership-mature — confident without over-selling, honest without underselling.

FY 2025 Performance Appraisal – Self-Assessment

James R. Wilkinson – Supervisory Inventory Management Specialist (GS-11)

1. LEADING CHANGE (Non-Critical)

When I was assigned to Personal Property Management (PPM), the program had been inconsistent for more than a decade. I accepted the challenge and began learning it while leading it, with very little established guidance. I focused on building structure and clarity where none existed. The Disposition Log and Excess Portal that I created gave the facility its first real, live view of property movement and accountability. They’ve since become foundational tools in bringing Pittsburgh into line with national expectations and gave our custodial officers confidence that someone is finally tracking the full lifecycle.

Change hasn’t been simple. Competing demands and legacy backlogs have created moments where the work outpaced capacity, and I take ownership for that. Each obstacle, however, forced better design and stronger processes. The program is now organized, auditable, and transparent—something that didn’t exist before. That progress has reshaped how we handle property across two campuses and several CBOCs, and it reflects the persistence and adaptability needed to keep veterans’ assets properly managed.

2. LEADING PEOPLE (Critical)

Leading three different operational areas—PPM, Mailroom, and Copy Center—has been a true test of coordination and patience. Staffing shortages, medical absences, and manual workloads have been constant challenges, especially in mail operations where we physically fold and meter hundreds of patient letters daily while hand-entering every package into required rate-shopping software. I couldn’t be as hands-on with every team as I wanted, often pulled into other urgent issues, but I stayed connected through regular check-ins, honest updates, and shared problem-solving. The teams knew I was in the fight with them even when I couldn’t be in the room.

Throughout the year I’ve reinforced a culture of accountability and respect rooted in the VA’s I CARE values. I communicate expectations clearly, own my mistakes, and encourage open discussion when something isn’t working. Even in stressful stretches, people have stayed professional and focused because they see that their efforts matter. We’ve weathered a heavy year together—and while not perfect, we’ve grown more resilient and aligned around our shared mission of supporting veterans.

3. BUSINESS ACUMEN (Non-Critical)

Balancing both property management and mail operations has required learning to manage people, time, and technology under tight resource constraints. Coming from a background in Material Handling and Mail, I had to quickly master the technical and regulatory side of asset accountability. I dug into VA Directive 7002, learned the audit standards line by line, and translated them into systems that actually fit our workflow. The Disposition Log, EE Tracker, and internal SharePoint tools now provide clear, current data for leadership and custodial officers instead of scattered spreadsheets.

Fiscal stewardship has been at the core of every change. I consolidated tracking efforts, cut redundant steps, and established reliable reporting that stands up to audits. Learning this work while simultaneously leading it has sharpened my judgment and sense of priority. Even when I’ve made errors, I’ve corrected them fast, documented the fix, and shared lessons with the team. The end result is a more responsible, transparent, and sustainable operation.

4. BUILDING COALITIONS (Non-Critical)

PPM touches nearly every service line in the facility, so collaboration was essential. Early in the year I opened steady communication with OIT, Biomed, FMS, and front-line departments to untangle old bottlenecks. Those conversations turned into shared workflows that reduced confusion about ownership of assets and timelines. I also made it a point to keep data and decisions visible—showing partners where we stood and what we needed from them. That transparency rebuilt trust and made problem-solving faster.

The same approach carried over to Mail operations. Working with HR, Safety, and Contracting kept critical functions staffed and compliant despite constant strain. My goal wasn’t to create formal committees—it was to build real working relationships that got things done. Even when issues resurfaced, we handled them with professionalism and follow-through, keeping customer confidence intact and maintaining the reputation of our section as reliable and solution-focused.

5. RESULTS DRIVEN (Critical)

The year brought measurable progress and a lot of hard lessons. PPM improved in every major category—record completeness, CSN accuracy, and valid-status tracking all moved toward required benchmarks, and more importantly, those numbers now rest on reliable systems rather than temporary pushes. The Disposition Log and Excess Portal made property accountability visible and traceable, turning long-standing compliance gaps into routine process.

There have been mistakes and setbacks, but we adapted quickly and came out stronger for it. Every miss became an opportunity to tighten controls or rethink the workflow. Mail operations also remained steady despite limited manpower and higher manual workload. We met all key deadlines, kept patient correspondence on schedule, and implemented the new rate-shopping process without service disruption. The results weren’t achieved under easy conditions—they were earned through teamwork, quick adjustment, and an unwillingness to let problems stop progress.

6. WHISTLEBLOWER PROTECTION (Critical)

I make sure employees understand their right to report concerns safely and the process for doing so. I talk about it openly during team discussions, include reporting contacts in our reference materials, and act quickly when someone raises an issue. Each situation is handled directly, documented, and resolved with fairness and respect. People know they can come forward, be heard, and see follow-through.

That straightforward consistency keeps the environment stable and fair. It isn’t complicated—listen, respond, close the loop—but it builds real confidence among the staff. Everyone knows that problems will be addressed, not ignored, which helps prevent small issues from turning into larger conflicts and keeps the workplace focused on serving veterans.

Would you like me to format this for VA Form 3482e submission (plain text, no emphasis, single column), or would you prefer one more pass to fine-tune tone or length before finalizing?
