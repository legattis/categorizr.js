EE Requests 2.0 – How To Guide

Overview

The EE Requests system is the central process for handling all new requests for Equipment & Equipment Tags (EE). It standardizes intake, ensures OIT approvals when required, and allows PPM to create and track tags with clear status changes.

This system replaces the old ad-hoc process and provides a single, structured workflow inside SharePoint.

Workflow Summary
	1.	Request Submitted
	•	Material Handlers (MHs), OIT, or general staff submit an EE Request through one of the three forms:
	•	UD Receiving – for University Drive intake staff
	•	HZ Receiving – for HJZ intake staff
	•	VAPHS General – for OIT or any other staff needing EE tags
	•	All forms feed into the central EE Request list.
	2.	Initial Status – REQUESTED
	•	All new entries are automatically marked REQUESTED.
	•	If the request comes from OIT and requires approval, it remains flagged for review.
	3.	OIT Review (if applicable)
	•	OIT sees requests requiring approval in their dedicated view.
	•	They approve or reject by filling the OIT response field.
	•	Once complete, the record updates and OIT instructions are cleared.
	4.	PPM Processing
	•	PPM monitors the central list.
	•	When tags are created, the status is updated to CREATED.
	•	The request now waits for physical application.
	5.	Application of Tags
	•	MHs or IMS staff mark the record as APPLIED once tags are affixed.
	•	Notes can be added for tracking or special handling.
	6.	Completion
	•	At this point, the request is fully satisfied.
	•	Historical data remains available for audit or reporting.

Status Codes
	•	REQUESTED – Form submitted, awaiting action
	•	CREATED – Tags generated by PPM
	•	APPLIED – Tags applied by MH/IMS
	•	REJECTED – Request closed without action (OIT only)

⸻

Roles & Responsibilities
	•	Requestors (Staff, MH, OIT) – Submit new requests via the correct form.
	•	OIT – Approves/Rejects requests flagged as OIT-related.
	•	PPM – Creates EE tags and updates status.
	•	MH/IMS – Applies tags and closes the request.

⸻

Tips for Users
	•	Always choose the correct form to avoid delays.
	•	Check your views – OIT sees only items needing their review; PPM sees all items.
	•	Keep statuses accurate; this drives reporting and prevents duplicate work.
	•	Comments/notes fields are encouraged for special circumstances.

Benefits of the New System
	•	Single, standardized entry point for all requests.
	•	Automatic routing and filtering for OIT approvals.
	•	Transparent tracking across REQUESTED → CREATED → APPLIED.
	•	Reduced errors and duplicate effort.
	•	Audit trail for compliance and reporting.
